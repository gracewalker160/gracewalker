    <h2>About</h2>
    </p>

    <p>Elote, a sublime side dish made with corn that will make you come back for more, and more. And since the corn is
        in season and most tender, the perfect opportunity presented itself to make it.</p>

    <p>We enjoy this dish from one of our favorite restaurants in town and the occasion rose itself to prepare it in my
        kitchen with a twist and share it with all of you, and I am confident that you love it. </p>

    <p>Elote is a very popular grilled Mexican street corn slathered with mayonnaise, seasoned with a kick of chili
        powder and fresh lemon juice. And let’s not forget the salty Cojita cheese and cilantro. Very messy to eat,
        however worth every bite.</p>

    <p>The traditional way of serving it is on the cob itself that is grilled. Having a child with braces makes it a
        bit challenging to do so. Thus this version.</p>

    <p>I did no use my barbeque grill but my over the stove grill pan. Doing so it tenderized the corn and brought out
        all the sweetness.</p>

    <p>The balance between the sweetness of the corn and the salty Cojita cheese is heaven for your taste buds. The hot
        sauce is just the perfect hint of heat that will linger with a great bold flavor of sweet corn in the forefront.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ears of corn, husk left intact</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha hot chili sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup cotija cheese, broken down into small chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cilantro finely chopped ground chili powder to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>Over a medium-hot grill roast, the corn until the husks are charred, about 10 minutes if done over the
                stove grill. Turn husk occasionally to uniformly char the husk while not burning the kernels underneath
                it. Set the charred husk aside to cool, then shuck them and cut off the corns from the cob.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Meanwhile in a small bowl mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, hot sauce, lime juice, chicken stock,
                salt, pepper, and sugar. Mix well and set aside</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>When ready to eat, in a large skillet add the corn and the mayonnaise mixture and sauté over medium-low
                heat, until warm. Pour into a bowl, garnish with cilantro, cheese, and chili powder.</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
