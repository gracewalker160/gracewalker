    <h1>Jersey Shore (TV series)</h1>
    <p> Jersey Shore is an American reality television series that ran on MTV from December 3, 2009, to December 20,
        2012. The series follows the lives of eight housemates at a vacation home in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, on
        the Jersey Shore in seasons one, three, five, and six; South Beach, Florida in season two, and Florence,
        Italy in season four.
        <br>
        <br>
        The show became a pop culture phenomenon with classes and conferences at universities about the show and
        journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time. The Shore franchise spawned several
        international adaptations in other countries. Four of the Jersey Shore case members received spin-off shows
        on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & Jwoww.

    <h2>The Jersey Shore House</h2>
    The Jersey Shore house is the
    name given to the house used on the MTV show Jersey Shore. Located in Seaside
    Heights, the house was used during the first season, starting on December 3, 2009, and was used on the show
    in four out of the six seasons, the exceptions being season two and season four.
    <br>
    <br>
    Since the show's cancellation, the house is currently being rented out for days at a time; it was reported
    in 2018 that the house was renting for $1,200 a night.
    <br>
    <br>
    The house was characterized by its unique decor and the hot tub. During the filming of Jersey Shore, the
    house was decorated with Scarface posters and Cadillac symbols and wheels. The house is also home to the
    duck phone, a home telephone in the form of a mallard duck. All the furniture that is seen on the show was
    brought in by the production company, including the hot tub, for which they needed a permit from Seaside
    Heights while filming.
    </p>

    <h2>Employment</h2>
    <p>
        While staying in Seaside Heights, N.J., the cast worked at a local boardwalk store, the "Shore Store", which
        was owned by Danny and Paul Merk. Danny was also the landlord of the cast's summer house. He described Mike
        Sorrentino, a self-proclaimed slacker, as the laziest guy in the world. However, he added that Mike was the
        most talented when it came to sales. The cast started off earning $10 an hour, receiving $20 an hour by the
        end of the series.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Miami season saw the group working at the Lecca Lecca Gelato Caffe situated in South Beach. Producers
        decided on the location due to its Italian roots. The cast "slaved over gelato", working four hour shifts.
        <br>
        <br>
        In Florence, the cast worked at the O'Vesuvio pizza parlor located near the Uffizi Gallery.
    </p>
    <h2>Governor Christie and the series' portrayal of New Jersey</h2>
    <p>In a February 2010 interview, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the show "negative for New Jersey"
        because most of the cast members are not from the state. According to Christie, the program "takes a bunch
        of New Yorkers and drops them at the Jersey Shore and tries to make America feel like this is the real New
        Jersey".
        <br>
        <br>
        Governor Christie took action against the series by trying to encourage people to experience the real Jersey
        Shore for themselves rather than watch it through MTV: "I can tell people: They wnt to know what New Jersey
        really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time."
        <br>
        <br>
        A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll released in Februaary 2010 showed that 59% of Americans who
        had seen the show had a favorable view of New Jersey compared to only 44% of those who had not seen the
        show. The FDU poll repeated the national telephone survey in 2011 and showed similar results. Consequently,
        poll director Peter Woolley concluded that "These measures...suggest the show isn't hurting the nation's
        view of the state. In fact, it may be promoting one of the state's best features -- not Snooki, but the
        shore itself."
        <br>
        <br>
        Nonetheless, in September 2011, Governor Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax incentive toward the show by the New
        Jersey Economic Development Authority, stating: "As chief executive, I am duty-bound to ensure that
        taxpayers are not footing a $420,000 bill for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate
        misconceptions about the state and its citizens."
