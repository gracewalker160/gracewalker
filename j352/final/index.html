    <h1>COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Vaccine Confidence for Children</h1>
<div class="container-fluid">
<article>
    A household pulse survey done by the U.S. Census Bureau shows that 206,613,749 people received at least one of the two initial doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, only 147,810,219 reported receiving their booster. According to the CDC, staying up to date on booster doses is critical in maintaining strong, long-lasting immunity against the coronavirus over time. 
    <br>
    <br>
One possible reason there is such a steep dropoff in how many people received the first two doses of the vaccine to how many people reported receiving a booster is increased vaccine hesitancy due to low vaccine confidence. The CDC defines vaccine confidence as the belief that vaccines work, are safe, and a part of a trustworthy medical system. 
<br>
<br>
Confidence in Covid-19 vaccines is crucial in slowing the spread of the virus and reducing hospitalizations and deaths. A crucial demographic to tackle when it comes to vaccine confidence and uptake is children. 
<br>
<br>
As of June 2022, Covid vaccines are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. However, according to CDC data of vaccination coverage and confidence among children, 62.5% of kids aged six months to 17 years remain unvaccinated as of October 29, 2022. It was also indicated within this dataset that 38.9% of parents were probably not or definitely not vaccinating their kids. This number was up from both August and September of this year, which showed 35.2% and 34.5%, respectively. 
<br>
<br>
A household pulse survey of over 33 million people done by the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that there are many factors that prevent parents from getting their children vaccinated, the biggest being parental concerns over potential side effects the vaccine could have on their children. Over 18 million people in the survey reported that this was a factor in their decision to not have their child vaccinated for Covid. 
<br>
<br>
10 million people noted that they kept their child unvaccinated against the virus because they do not believe children need vaccines, while 1.5 million people reported that they do not vaccinate their children at all. 12 million people reported that they do not trust the covid-19 vaccine in particular. 
<br>
<br>
The CDC has highlighted major themes from social media and news outlets that they believe may be contributing to vaccine hesitancy for children in the COVID-19 State of Vaccine Confidence Insights Report released in August 2022. This report noted five main threats to vaccine confidence. These threats are: 
<ul>
    <li>Fear of serious side effects in children</li>
    <li>The belief that the need for a COVID-19 vaccine reduces or goes away entirely if a person has already been infected with and recovered from Covid</li>
    <li>The FDA moved too slowly to approve COVID vaccines for children</li>
    <li>Parents being against childhood immunization</li>
    <li>Low vaccine confidence leading to low vaccination levels in children</li>  
</ul>

The report also identified three points of misinformation found online that could negatively impact vaccine confidence. These points are: 
<ul>
<li>Children who receive the COVID-19 vaccine are at a high risk of death.</li>
<li>COVID-19 poses no risk to children.</li>
<li>COVID-19 vaccines give children hepatitis.</li>
</ul>
