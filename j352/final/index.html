            A <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/hhp/hhp48.html">household pulse survey done by the
                U.S. Census Bureau</a> shows that 206,613,749 people in the U.S. received
            at least one of the two initial doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, only 147,810,219 reported receiving
            their booster. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html">According
                to the CDC,</a> staying up to date on booster doses is critical in maintaining strong,
            long-lasting immunity against the coronavirus.

            Booster shots are crucial in protecting against new emerging variants and new, different spawns of the
            Omicron variant. The second booster dose, which was approved by the FDA and <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html#:~:text=Updated%20COVID%2D19%20boosters%20add,more%20transmissible%20and%20immune%2Devading.">recommended
                by the CDC</a> this past
            September, has been reworked to protect against various strains of the Omicron variant, which had previously
            shown capabilities of evading the initial booster dose.

            Alex Rogan, a junior at the University of Maryland, is studying abroad in Florence, Italy in the spring 2023
            semester, and she says she’s doing what she can to protect herself from getting sick or potentially
            infecting anyone else while she’s there. “I got my first booster in November of last year, and I’m getting
            my second dose now to protect myself and those around me.”

            “The updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating
            COVID-19 variant. They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were
            designed to provide broader protection against newer variants,” said Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, Director of
            the CDC, in <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html#:~:text=Updated%20COVID%2D19%20boosters%20add,more%20transmissible%20and%20immune%2Devading.">the
                September press release</a> announcing the approval and recommendation of the booster.

            One possible reason there is a dropoff of over 58 million people receiving the first doses of the vaccine to
            how many people reported receiving a booster is increased vaccine hesitancy due to low vaccine confidence.
            The CDC defines <a

                confidence</a> as the belief that vaccines work, are safe, and a part of a trustworthy
            medical system.
            <br>
            <br>
            Confidence in Covid-19 vaccines is crucial in slowing the spread of the virus and reducing hospitalizations
            and deaths. A crucial demographic to tackle when it comes to vaccine confidence and uptake is children.

            As of June 2022, Covid vaccines are recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older. However, according to
            <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence/building-trust.html#:~:text=Strong%20confidence%20in%20COVID%2D19,illnesses%2C%20hospitalizations%2C%20and%20deaths">CDC
                data</a> of vaccination coverage and confidence among children, 62.5% of kids in the U.S. aged six
            months to
            17 years remain unvaccinated as of October 29, 2022. It was also indicated within this dataset that 38.9% of
            parents were probably not or definitely not vaccinating their kids. This number was up from both August and
            September of this year, which showed 35.2% and 34.5%, respectively.
            <br>
            <br>
            A Census <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2022/demo/hhp/hhp48.html">survey</a> of over 33 million
            people has shown that there are many factors that prevent parents from
            getting their children vaccinated, the biggest being concerns over potential side effects the vaccine could
            have on children. Over 18 million people in the survey reported that this was a factor in their decision to
            not have their child vaccinated for Covid.
            <br>
            <br>
            10 million people noted that they kept their child unvaccinated against the virus because they do not
            believe children need vaccines, while 1.5 million people reported that they do not vaccinate their children
            at all. 12 million people reported that they do not trust the covid-19 vaccine in particular.

            According to the <a
                href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-july-2022/">Kaiser
                Family Foundation</a>, 53% of parents of the youngest children believe vaccinating
            their child poses a bigger risk to their health than actually getting COVID-19, and a majority of parents of
            children under the age of five say the information available to them about the vaccine for kids in that age
            group is confusing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Initially only approved in September for children 12 and up, the CDC <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1012-COVID-19-Vaccines.html">expanded the booster</a> in
            October to
            include children ages 5-11. Among parents of children in this age group who have already been vaccinated,
            20% say their child has already received a booster dose and a majority say they will “definitely” or
            “probably” get one. 22% of parents of children in the 5-11 age group say they will “probably not” or
            “definitely not” get their child boosted.
            <br>
            <br>
            The CDC has highlighted major themes from social media and news outlets that they believe may be
            contributing to vaccine hesitancy for children in the <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence/building-trust.html#:~:text=Strong%20confidence%20in%20COVID%2D19,illnesses%2C%20hospitalizations%2C%20and%20deaths">COVID-19
                State of Vaccine Confidence Insights Report</a>
            released in August 2022. This report noted five main threats to vaccine confidence. These threats are: <ul>
                <li>Some parents fear serious side effects for their children.</li>
                <li>The belief that the need for a COVID-19 vaccine reduces or goes away entirely if a child has already
                    been infected with and recovered from Covid.</li>
                <li>The FDA moved too slowly to approve COVID vaccines for children.</li>
                <li>Some parents are simply against childhood immunization.</li>
                <li>Low vaccine confidence leads to low vaccination levels in children.</li>
            </ul>

            The report also identified three points of misinformation found online that could negatively impact vaccine
            confidence. These points are:
            <ul>
                <li>Children who receive the COVID-19 vaccine are at a high risk of death.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 poses no risk to children.</li>
                <li>COVID-19 vaccines give children hepatitis.</li>
            </ul>

            Overall, increased vaccine confidence, for both adults and children, will help stop the spread of COVID-19,
            which will in turn reduce hospitalizations and deaths. In order to reach this point and increase confidence
            in the safety, effectiveness, and necessity of vaccines, misinformation on social media must be combated by
            data and easily accessible, easy to understand information from reputable health organizations. For some, it
            could just be the difference between life and death.
